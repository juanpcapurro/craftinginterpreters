Craftinginterpreters solutionaire
=================================

this repository cointains my implementation of Lox as I'm following the
[book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

you will find the following directories

challenges
----------
Solutions to the different challenges usually found at the end of each chapter. I wanna say from the
get go that I'm not intending on maxing the book and *will* skip most of them. This is a note more
for myself than for you.

java
----
Java implementation of the Lox lexer. Or at least that's what I have laid out for today. Some day
it might even be a parser.

c
-
sempai said there's going to be some C coding for the lox execution layer. Will get to it in time.
