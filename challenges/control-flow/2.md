Iteration can be implemented with recursion, I don't know if the dynamic dispatch and first-class
functions are necessary.

Tail call elimination, that is, forgetting the current stack frame when a function call is performed
as the last instruction of a function, allows looping by recursion to be performed in an efficient
manner, since otherwise the stack size would grow linearly with the amount of iterations.
