Smalltalk doesn't have branching statements, instead, Boolean objects have `ifTrue:` and `ifFalse:`
methods which take a function (or 'block', as are anonymous first-class functions called in
Smalltalk)

Depending on if the Boolean object is of class `True` or `False`, the implementation executes or
discards the passed block, having the same effect as an `if` statement.
