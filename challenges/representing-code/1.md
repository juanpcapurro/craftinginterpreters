each thing inside `<hr>s` will represent the same grammar, but in a simpler form

---
expr â†’ expr ( "(" ( expr ( "," expr )* )? ")" | "." IDENTIFIER )+ | IDENTIFIER | NUMBER

---
expr -> expr ( "(" ( expr ( "," expr )* )? ")" | "." IDENTIFIER )+
expr -> IDENTIFIER 
expr -> NUMBER

---
expr -> expr "(" params ")"
expr -> expr "(" ")"
expr -> expr "." IDENTIFIER

params -> expr
params -> params "," expr

expr -> IDENTIFIER 
expr -> NUMBER


> Bonus: What kind of expression does this bit of grammar encode?

it's the grammar for method invocation and field access, assuming numbers are callable and
everything can have a field.
