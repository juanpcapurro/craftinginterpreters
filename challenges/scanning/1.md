> The lexical grammars of Python and Haskell are not regular. What does that mean, and why arenâ€™t they?

I'm not at all familiar with haskell so my answer applies to python only

In python, whitespace is used to determine "blocks" via indentation, and the language isn't
opinionated on how many spaces to use (or wether to use tabs), instead counting the
whitespace before the first statement and then expecting

- an increase in that amount of whitespace to create a token for a block start, similar to a `{` in c
- a decrease in that amount of whitespace to create a token for a block end, similar to a `{` in c

therefore, the lexer has to count an amount and type of characters which are dependent on what's
supplied at runtime, so a finit state machine can't be designed to supply that requirement.

Well, in practice you could perhaps designe one such machine that's indistinguishable for most
python code, but you would have many (say, one for 1 tab and 7 for all indentations from 1 to 8
spaces) repeated parts of the machine after finding the first whitespace character, which would make
evident how much of a hack that is.
