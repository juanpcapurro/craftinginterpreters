`git-blame` this file to know where to apply it. this will break if I modify this file in the future, idk.

> Consider allowing them to nest. Is adding support for nesting more work than you expected? Why?

It'd be quite a bit of work since I'd have to count how many levels deep in nesting I am and
increase/reduce a counter to know if it's gramatically correct or not. A more idiomatic way to do it
would perhaps be to use a recursive function.

Given that parsing it wouldn't be feasible with a finite automata, but would be doable with a
stack, it'd mean the grammar is context-free and not regular. I think. Don't quote me on that.
