> Aside from separating tokens—distinguishing print foo from printfoo—spaces aren’t used for much in most languages. However, in a couple of dark corners, a space does affect how code is parsed in CoffeeScript, Ruby, and the C preprocessor. Where and what effect does it have in each of those languages?

Again, I'll only answer regarding the c preprocessor.

the c preprocessor handles [trigraph replacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_trigraph) where
having for example `??/` translates to `\`, but `? ? \` doesn't.
