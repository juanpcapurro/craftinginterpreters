> Our scanner here, like most, discards comments and whitespace since those arenâ€™t needed by the parser. Why might you want to write a scanner that does not discard those? What would it be useful for?

The main use for not discarding comments in the scanner, I believe, are type annotations, where
information about the expected/declared type of variables is written in comments and then the
parser determines wether objects of the expected types will be passed at runtime and can warn the
developer if that isn't the case, in a way that's backwards-compatible. An example of this is
[flow](https://flow.org/) (now mostly forgotten thanks to the success of typescript).

Another use is for documenting the defined objects. I believe Python's docstrings aren't the case
since they're tecnically expressions, but Solidity's natspec is written in comments and discrepacies
between the documented and actual types cause compiler errors
