> Add support for comma expressions. Give them the same precedence and associativity as in C. Write the grammar

okay, so the current grammar is:

    expression     -> equality ;
    equality       -> comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
    comparison     -> term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
    term           -> factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
    factor         -> unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
    unary          -> ( "!" | "-" ) unary
                | primary ;
    primary        -> NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil"
                | "(" expression ")" ;

And the comma operator should have the lowest possible precendence (in C it has higher precedence
than the semicolon, but since we don't deal with statements for now, I can avoid it.)

I think the syntax can be defined as:

    comma          -> expression ("," expression)* ;
    expression     -> equality ;
    equality       -> comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
    comparison     -> term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
    term           -> factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
    factor         -> unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
    unary          -> ( "!" | "-" ) unary
                | primary ;
    primary        -> NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "nil"
                | "(" expression ")" ;

Its definition looks like a binary operator, because it is one.
however I can't put it with the rest of the binary operators because its precendce is way lower

I'm gonna make it left-associative but without any reason behind it. Perhaps when it comes to
executing it, it'd make more sense to have it as right-associative depending on how I have to
traverse the AST to discard the left operand's value.
