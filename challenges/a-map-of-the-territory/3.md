> Most Lisp implementations that compile to C also contain an interpreter that lets them execute Lisp code on the fly as well. Why?

first reason is that having a REPL is an awesome thing to have for development. Python's pdb for
example lets you run code from files normally and drops you onto a REPL when instructed and it's a
lifesaver.

Just using a REPL is a great way to
- get to know a new language
- run quick proofs of concept
- use as a fast tool for another purpose, such as a calculator or one-off data processing
