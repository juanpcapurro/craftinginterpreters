I'm gonna pick Solidity, since that's what I'm familiar with. Although I'm not gonna pick solhint
because that'd be cheating.

you can find the repository in: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity

there are two .g4 files, but they're under doc/ and seem to be read by sphinx and the
test_antlr_grammar.sh script only.  the test_antlr_grammar saves sources to build/antlr/src. But
they're java sources. They seem to be used to check the implementation against the spec.

As for the code that actually makes it into solc:

scanner/lexer: liblangutil/Scanner.{h,cpp}
parser: liblangutil/Parser{,Base}.{h,cpp}

the scanner is mostly called by the parser, its class even has it as an attribute and has methods
taking a bare char stream as parameter. Something something composition

but there are some uses of the scanner inside optimizers as well. 

the parser is used for regular compiling in libsolidity/interface/CompilerStack.cpp. Frontend-ier
stuff happens elsewhere dealing with where the sources come from and the like
