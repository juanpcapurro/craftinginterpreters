> what reasons are _not_ to JIT

I can think of complexity only. It sounds like it'd make debugging especially difficult, since you'd
have to either:
- disable JIT when debugging and live with having the production deployment be potentially different
than the thing you can debug
- optionally include debugging symbols in the compiled representation

Also (and I had to google it): overhead. Even if you get a JIT implementation that doesn't bork you
existing debugger and takes zero of your person-hours, for programs that are expected to execute
fast, do few things and exit (think of shell scripts, most things you do with Lua, the python code
in a Jupyter notebook which is changed more often than it's run), it'd make program startup slower
and not contribute to performance that much
