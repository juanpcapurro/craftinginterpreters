> Lox is a pretty tiny language. What features do you think it is missing that would make it annoying to use for real programs? (Aside from the standard library, of course.)

from the previous answer:
- introspection
    - object's attributes
    - function arity
    - instanceof and siblings
- class attributes?
- ARRAYS
- modules / exporting / importing
