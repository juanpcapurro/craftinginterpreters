```
var a=4;
var a=5;
print a;
```
doesn't yield an error. Variable re-definition is allowed

```
var a=5;
{
    var a = 6;
    print a; // 6
}
print a; // 5
```
scope shadowing works as expected

```
class C {
    var c = 9;
    init(newc) {
        c = newc;
        this.c = newc;
    }
}
var i = C(10); 
print C.c; 
print i.c; 
```
only instances can have attributes or fields. No way to define 'static' methods AFAICT.

function definition is a *statement*, which defines the function and registers a name
this means, the following is legal:

```
fun idk(param) {print param;}
var f = idk;
f("yey");
```

but anonymous function definitions and separate name assgnment are not:
```
var f = fun (param) {print param;}
f("yey");
```
