    fun scope(a) {
        var a = "local";
    }

yes, it's valid, but because it's legal to re-declare variables, for the reason given in chapter
8 that doing otherwise would interact poorly with a REPL experience.

They're in the same scope, as implemented in com/craftinginterpreters/lox/LoxFunction.java:call

Lox lets me shadow any kind of declaration/definition. Most languages let you shadow declartions in
outer scopes, but not in the current one. I think that's sensible for languages where assignment and
declaration are separate operations.

If it's not possible to _assign_ to an existing name, then that might be annoying, specially in a
scripting language.
