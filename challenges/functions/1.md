Smalltalk doesn't have that problem because the arguments for a method call are part of the
method's name.

Smalltalk calls look like:

    recruiter ifNotPsychopath: candidate sendToTechnicalInterview: interviewer

if the `recruiter` object has a method conforming to `ifNotPsychopath: a sendToTechnicalInterview:
b`, then it is called, otherwise it's an error to call an undefined method.

and calling:

    recruiter ifNotPsychopath: candidate

is a call to a *different* method. Which may or may not be defined.
