I think it's best to have numbers constantly behave as floats, enabling the user to not think about
what'll be used to represent the value internally.

C programs crash with `SIGFPE` on divisions between ints, which is weird since when *actually* using
floats, it evaluate to `NaN` without errors. I guess this is to fail fast when possible, but also
comply with ieee754

Java crashes with an `java.lang.ArithmeticException` when dividing ints, and evaluates `Infinity`
when dividing floats, similar to C

Python always crashes, for both regular division and comment-looking divission

Javascript always returns Infinity

When I have an internet connection I~'ll~ might research the reasons
