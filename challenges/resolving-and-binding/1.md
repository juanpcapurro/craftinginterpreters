It's safe to do so because the name of a function and its arity are all that's needed to _define_
its name, and the invocation, where the actual body of the function is executed, is necessarily a
later step, which might also use the (then fully defined) name.

Variables, however, have their initializer executed right away, so they cannot refer to their own
name.
